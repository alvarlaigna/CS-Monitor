# CS Monitor
## What's CS monitor?

Monitor - a platform application that provides the ability to view the register of public transactions (transfers).
The CS monitor is a web-based version of the application that provides the ability to view the public transfer register. The monitor is implemented in C# and connects to the peer-to-peer network using the platform API. Statistics are updated every second.
The CS monitor page contains the following information:
* The total number of nodes in the network;
* Transaction statistics;
* Balance;
* Detailing the transactions of the selected wallet;
* General information on the smart contract;
* An overview of the open smart contract.

The monitor is implemented on the basis of the Node architecture. To provide up-to-date information, the Monitor receives information about all the changes in the blocks, but does not participate in the rounds.
